<dd>A passphrase-protected private key file will remain on this computer after the Launcher exits.</dd>

<p>The Launcher's preferred mode of operating (&quot;private mode&quot;) involves creating a &quot;~/.ssh/MassiveLauncherKey&quot; private key file within your home directory,
and using an SSH Agent (e.g. PuTTY's Pageant) to load the private key into memory, so that you don't need to enter your password
every time you run the Launcher.</p>
<p>If you are running the Launcher on a shared computer (e.g. if you are using a &quot;Guest&quot; account), then you should use &quot;public mode&quot;.
When running in &quot;public mode&quot; you will need to enter your password every time you run the Launcher.
