<h2>SSH Keys</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Private key</dt>
<dd>A file (usually kept within a ".ssh" subdirectory of your user home directory), which is used instead of a password to grant you access to a remote server.</dd>
<dt>Public key</dt>
<dd>A "padlock" whose lock matches your private key.  You can place a copy of the same public key ("padlock") on any server you would like to access with your private key.</dd>
<dt>Passphrase</dt>
<dd>If another user has access to your computer, then they could potentially steal your private key file to gain access to
servers secured with your corresponding public key ("padlock").  You can prevent this by securing the private key with a passphrase.  
Unlike a password, the private key (including the encoded passphrase) stays on your local computer, so there is less risk of
a remote server allowing a mailicious person to acquire your credentials.
